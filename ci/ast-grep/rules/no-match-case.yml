id: no-match-case
message: "Structural pattern matching (match/case) is not allowed"
severity: error
language: Python

rule:
  pattern: |
    match $VAR:
        $$$

note: |
  This rule is mainly because Cython does not currently support match/case statements.
  
  Example that WILL trigger this rule:
    match value:
        case 1:
            print("one")
        case _:
            print("other")
  
  Use if-elif-else instead:
    if value == 1:
        print("one")
    else:
        print("other")
